# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

A growing collection of beginner to intermediate-level Python mini projects, created as part of my **daily Python practice**.  
These projects are ideal for:
- 🧠 Beginners starting with Python
- 🔁 Anyone looking to **revise and reinforce core concepts**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(I proudly belong to the latter!)*
